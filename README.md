# How to calculate CUSTOMER LIFE TIME VALUE (CLTV) using BG/NBD  Model in Python

Calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is considered crucial in marketing and ecommerce, yet most companies can’t do it properly. This interesting approach tells you their total lifetime with company and predicts value each customer will bring to your business over their lifetime.
CLTV can be used to help focus our attention on retaining the most important customers and acquiring others like them, and it can help us forecast what you’ll get from our customers if you can retain them. It’s also really useful for demonstrating the bigger picture to non-marketers who may think only of the operational costs of resolving issues, instead of the cost of losing a valuable customer.

# How many customers do you really have?
In a contractual churn setting, like a mobile phone network or a broadband provider, you can tell how many of your customers are still customers (or “alive” as in the world of CLTV), because you know how many open contracts you have. You observe the time at which they “die” because they fail to renew their contract and you get time to try and prevent them churning because you know the point at which they might die.
In non-contractual churn settings, like most ecommerce businesses, the time of a customer’s “death” isn’t directly observed, so you never really know which ones are alive or dead. That makes determining how many active customers you have is much harder. It’s therefore little surprise that CLTV isn’t measured as often as you might think, especially in smaller ecommerce businesses.
Customers often vary dramatically in their behaviour - some order weekly and others order annually.  If a customer normally orders from you every month and hasn’t shopped for a year, do you really think they’re still alive?
